# dotfiles

This is my dotfiles. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Warning

If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository,
review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my
settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!
